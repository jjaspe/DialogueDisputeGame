MainForm
- MainForm sends view messages to MainController, MainController handles action
	- If CreateCharacter, MainController creates a CreateCharacterForm, and registers itself as 
	an observer of said form.

CreateCharacterForm
- When exiting, update observers, one of which is MainForm, so MainForm displays again after CreateCharacterForm is closed
