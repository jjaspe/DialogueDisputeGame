ISSUES
	

FIXED
	- If we create a client c1, create a game,then create a second client c2, create a game, 
	c2's game list doesnt get updated
		FIX: Maybe the same changes to previous error, removing the acks probably fixed it.
	- Game creator is not getting updated when he creates game 
		- Doens't happen while debugging so it should be a problem with thread speed
		- getGames() is not being called for game Player1
		FIX: It seems like several messages were being sent from the server before the first one was read
		so one getData() would consume two messages at once, sometimes including the "stop" message, so 
		the getGames() loop wouldn't never stop. So we put acks in between every sendData to make sure each
		message is consumed one by one. These acks will not cause problems like before because the sendGame calls are being
		ran in their appropriate thread.

	- When we click on different matches in game list, active match group doesnt update
		Fix: MainForm was creating NamedParameters to put inside the args list, when it 
		doesn't need to. All it needs to create is objects. MainFormController will 
		be in charge of translating those into named parameters depending on the data 
		it needs to complete the request.
